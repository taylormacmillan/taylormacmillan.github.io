			<p>An exciting journey beginning with my introduction to Systems Design Engineering, and the completion of several co-op positions on the road to becoming a product manager.</p>

			<h3 class="subheader">The Kickoff</h3>
			<p>My journey began with my decision to pursue a degree in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. All my life, I have been the person you can count on to ask "why", questioning anything and everything that I can. Combine this with my passion for all the maths and sciences, and Systems Design Engineering seemed the perfect choice for me. A program that encourages design-oriented students to apply a holistic approach to solving complex multidisciplinary problems, from day one this program more than met my expectations.</p>
			<p>One of the greatest aspects of my program is the six co-op placements we get to complete as part of the degree requirements. That's six chances to join different companies, test out various job positions, and directly apply newly learned skills in an environment that interests us!</p>
			<p>As someone never quite satisfied with only being involved in a single type of work, I spent my first few co-op placements exploring different engineering fields. First, I had the opportunity to explore working in a manufacturing setting completing 3D designs and multiple process improvement plans for the facility. I next switched gears by joining a consulting firm in the mechanical and electrical engineering field, designing electrical systems for a variety of sectors. Following this I once again pursued a different goal, completing an internship as a software engineer in the neuroinformatics community.</p>
			<p>These placements not only gave me the chance to build up my collection of professional and technical skills, but to experience working in a variety of different company environments. I learned how to integrate seamlessly into numerous team dynamics, adapt fluidly to changing priorities, and manage communications with large networks of stakeholders.</p>
			<p class="section-summary">Now approaching the halfway point of my education, it was time to narrow my focus and further shape my career.</p>

			<h3 class="subheader">Designer</h3>
			<p>My love for product design was officially cemented for me when I got the chance to learn various user-centered design techniques in my school courses, and then directly apply them to several fascinating projects. Understanding the end users of a product, identifying and distinguishing between their wants and needs, and developing potential product features are pieces of a puzzle that I absolutely thrive on fitting together.</p>
			<p>I had the opportunity to explore this avenue as a career path in my fourth co-op placement, in which I began working as a front-end developer with a particular focus on UI/UX design. Analyzing user actions, mocking up wireframes to visualize feature proposals, developing interactive prototypes, and writing the code to implement the end solution was a typical week for me. I loved being able to bring both internal and customer visions to life, seeing my designs become a reality right before my eyes.</p>
			<p class="section-summary">Yet, I still felt that there was something missing for me.</p>

			<h3 class="subheader">Product Manager</h3>
			<p>The depth and breadth of experience I've developed as a result of spending my first two years exploring such diverse opportunities have ultimately led me to exactly where I need to be. My firsthand experience in all stages of the product development lifecycle in a variety of different fields, as well as managing large networks of stakeholders in these areas, has placed me in the perfect position to transition smoothly into a product management role. I can confidently analyze a situation and identify how best to leverage everyone's strengths, and recognize when a product/feature proposal will be successful or when another option should be explored.</p>
			<p>My transition into product management occurred partway into my fourth co-op placement, after I expressed an interest in and began taking on more product-focused tasks. After officially joining the product management team, I finally got to experience the thrill of working in the exact environment in which I thrive: innovative, fast-paced, and dynamic. At a high level, as a PM I balance the wants and needs of customers, internal team members, and key external parties, all while ensuring we pursue the best direction for the company as a whole. Currently, I've continued to develop my experience in this role while completing my fifth co-op placement as a Program Manager at Microsoft.</p>
			<p>Developing product features and carrying them from the ideation to implementation stage is where my passions truly lie, and a task I get to carry out in my daily work. To many, the exact role of a product manager is still quite mystifying and varies largely between different companies. Every day can be vastly different, but that's what makes it so interesting.</p>
			<p class="section-summary">The route I've taken to get here has been full of new experiences, and I can't wait to see how my future progresses!</p>
