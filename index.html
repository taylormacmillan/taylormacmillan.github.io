		<div class="main-intro">
			<p>Hey, I'm Taylor! I'm currently studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo, pursuing my passions for <span id="design-colour">product management</span> and <span id="design-colour">design</span>. I thrive on transforming initial product visions from ideas into reality. I'm currently seeking a 4 month product management internship for the Fall 2019 term.</p>

		<div class="about-me">
			<h3>My Story</h3>
			<p>Always one to question "why" to everything I encounter, my natural curiosity and drive to understand the world has led me to pursue a career in which I not only find the answers to these questions, but get to create them myself. I design products with someone like me in mind, so that even the most inquisitive end users will not need to question "why".</p>
			<p>To learn more about my journey as a student and working professional, and how the decisions I've made have shaped my career, see my <a href="experience.html"><span id="design-colour">experience</span></a> here.</p>
			<p>Besides going to school and working, you can typically find me outside engaging in whatever activity the season calls for! That deep-seated curiosity has driven me to pursue a number of different sports and activities, from downhill skiing and snowshoeing in the winter to wakeboarding and swimming in the summer.</p>

			<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
			<p>As mentioned, a main passion of mine is being outdoors. Naturally then, after completing a 10km road race I've decided to take the next step and am currently training for my first half-marathon. To add a little extra fun into the equation, I also have plans to complete my first triathlon in the near future!</p>
			<p>During the completion of one of my internships, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility's Annual Congress. See my presentation <a href="https://f1000research.com/posters/7-1288" target="blank"><span id="design-colour">here</span></a>!</p>
